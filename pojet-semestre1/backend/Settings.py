    #----------------------------------------------enable FEATURES--------------------------------------------

    enableFeed = True  # Enables the feeding mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can eat food and other bobs.

    enablePerception = True  # Enables the perception mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can see food and other bobs in a certain radius around them.

    enableMovement = True  # Enables the movement mechanism for Bob objects. If set to False, all bobs will be static.

    enableEnergyConsumption = True  # Enables the energy consumption mechanism for Bob objects. Faster bobs consume more energy, etc

    enableMemory = True  # Enables the memory mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can remember the location of food they have seen.

    enableMass = True  # Enables the mass mechanism for Bob objects.

    enableVelocity = True  # Enables the velocity mechanism for Bob objects. 

    enableSmoothMovement = True # Enables the smooth movement mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs move smoothly instead of jumping from cell to cell.

    donut = False  # Enables the donut grid mode. Instead of having a border, the grid is a donut. Bobs can go through the edges and appear on the opposite side.

    enableAnimation = True # Enables the animation mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs have an animation when they move, eat, etc.

    computeColorSprite = False  # Enables the color mechanism for Bob objects. Faster bobs are redder, etc

    enableEffects = True # Enables the effects mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can be affected by effects such as being spit at.

    enableSpitting = True # Enables the spitting mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can spit ammos to hinder other bobs.

    enableSexualReproduction = True # Enables the sexual reproduction mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can reproduce with other bobs.

    enableParthenogenesis = True # Enables the parthenogenesis mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can reproduce without other bobs.

    enableMutation = True # Enables the mutation mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can mutate when they reproduce.

    enableMutantFood = False # Enables the apparition of mutantFood

    enableIsotonicDrinks = False # Enables the apparition of isotonic drinks, food that reduces the energy consumption of a bob when eaten

    enableMassMaxEnergy = False # Enables the massMaxEnergy mechanism for Bob objects. Bobs can have a maximum energy depending on their mass.
